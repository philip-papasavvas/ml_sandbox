This is an area devoted to doing some Machine Learning projects, using scikit-learn, TensorFlow and pyTorch. Modules such as TensorFlow and pyTorch will link to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb) workbooks, where we can use GPUs.

TO-DO
* [X] PCA first principals
* [X] pyTorch tutorial [60 minute blitz](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html) - including training a neural network
* [ ] Re-familiarise myself with SQL using [SQLZOO](https://www.sqlzoo.net/)
* [ ] TensorFlow tutorials (Keras basics with Fashion MNIST dataset)
* [ ] IRIS dataset
