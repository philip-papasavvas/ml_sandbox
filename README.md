This repostiory contains all things machine learning with the following packages:
* notebook-projects
  * Breast Cancer - PCA: carry out a principal component analysis on the **breast_cancer** dataset from [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) 
  * Diabetes - linear regression: apply a linear regression model to the **diabetes** dataset from [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) (to finish)
  * Natural Language Processing on SMS messages: apply tokenization and normalisation on the SMS spam dataset from [UCI Machine learning](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection)
* pyTorch tutorials (using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb) workbooks for GPU), taken from the [60 minute blitz](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html)
  * Autograd - automatic differentiation for all operations on tensors
  * CIFAR10 - 60,000 images consisting of images belonging to 10 different classes, (airplane, automobile, bird,e etc.), taken from the [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)
  * Neural Networks - walk through of how to use pyTorch
  * Tensors introduction
